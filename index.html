        Transformers is a fictional show, movie and comic book franchise that many people loved. </span>
        It was originated in Japan with a company, Takara's Diaclone,the company released and sold 
        transforming mech toys for children. Then, during in the 1980s, another company who is called
        the Micro Change toylines had rebranded it in the United States which is also for children.
        By 1984, a cartoon of the Transformers was made, it had four seasons and lasted for more than
        two years. A decade later, a movie of theshow was made called The Transformers: The Movie.The
        next few decades were animated shows of the Transformers. Until, a director, Michael Bay made
        the Transformers trilogy from 2007-2011 and a duology from 2014-2017, the movies were loved by
        many Transformers fans, including I. The next few movies are Bumblebee and Transformers: Rise
        of The Beasts, they are not sequels but a reboot.
